The verb “traverse” is defined as “to pass or move over, along, or through”. Hence traversability
refers to the affordance of being able to traverse


The learning and perception of traversability is
a fundamental competence for both organisms and autonomous mobile robots since most of their
actions depend on their mobility.

If we use just the sensor to make decisions then the output is the same regardless of the obstacle

Uses svm

Traversal cost prediction

Self-supervised learning method
that accurately predicts traversal costs over large areas from
overhead data. 

outdoor robot navigation can benefit from the
now widespread availability of high quality overhead imagery
and elevation data from satellite and aircraft 

Presently, nearly the entire world has been surveyed at 1 m accuracy, 

Uses a linear-Gaussian model

Geometric

geometric‐based analyses aim to detect traversability using geometric properties of surfaces such as distances in space and shapes.

Whereas appearance methods, to a greater extent related to camera images processing and cognitive analyses, have the objective of recognize colors and patterns not related to the common appearance of terrain, such as grass, rocks or vegetation 

Legged locomotion is capable of traversing more difﬁcultterrain since it only requires isolated feasible footholds. Thedrawback of this locomotion mode is, that motion planningis much more complex.
