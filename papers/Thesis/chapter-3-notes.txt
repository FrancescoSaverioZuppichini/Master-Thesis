-[ ] Rewrite first paragraph.
- [x] Software listing should be in paragraph stile instead of subsubsection. Also, it should be good if your list the software in a grouping fashion, e.g. software for simulation, data preprocessing, CNN tranining, evaluation -- this gives a better understanding.
-[x] k-rock was created at the biorobotic laboratory at EPFL (https://biorob.epfl.ch/)
- [] You can use this text to describe the robot
 [] "K-rock robot was created for the porpuse of montoring real crocodiles, hence it must walk and behave realistically enough to fool the real crocodiles." And then you put your descriptions of its morphology and locomotion.
- [ ]Fig. 4.3 show the locomotion "gait" of the robot. Have you checked the simulation to see what is the height of the body (with respect to the ground) in this gait. I mention this because it has to do with the traversability learned.
- You have to mention that the forward command is the only command used to gather data, and that the traversability estimation is linked to it, i.e. you cannot estimate if the robot can traverse a patch while moving sideways.
- [ ] First paragraph of section 2.4: remove the first sentence.
- [x] "Each map is stored as heightmap, a 2D array, an image, where each pixel's value represents the terrain" those commas make it confusing, is the map those 3 things or one of those three things and the other two are another way to call it? (I know is the second but the reviewers do not). Rewrite it and whatever concept you use the most, stablish it as an standard in all the document, i.e. 2D image, elevation map or heightmap.
- [x] What does this mean "with features size ∈ [200, 100, 50, 25] ."? Which features?
- [ ] "Flat grounds with slots." Slot is a hole? a hole in the shape of rail?
- the list of map types is disconnected, use : to list them; also mention the figures they relate to.
- In section Simulator you repeat things from the robot section. 
- [ x ] What is webots? I know you define it later on but at least mention what does it do, e.g. "We used Webots as the simulation plaform for the robot model and the generated terrains ..."
- Is it important to mention what the name of the library you implemented is? This will generate confusion because it soudns disconnected, like a random fact. IF you want to mention it, introduce it in other way. For example, use a figure to show how your simulation module works, then there name a submodule with your library and show how it deals with the robot's model and loaded in a generated terrain. 
- This section needs more work to show how you implemented this module of your proposed framework. Give it order or structure. A reader, must understand what did you do even if they do not know the libraries/code/technology.
-There are two simulation-related sections/subsections why is that? make only one that mentions what you do. Then in other sections, e.g. data gathering, re use or explain in detailed what is missing from the simulation section.
- "After the run Krock on each map, we need to extract the patches for each stored pose p i and compute the advancement for a given time window, ∆t ." From each trajectory, what you did in simulation was to command the robot to move forward for 2 secs, i.e. created a trajectory from the spawning pose to the pose reached at the end of those 2 secs of moving forward. Ergo, you have to extract the patches at each pose of the trajectory generated at simulation time.
