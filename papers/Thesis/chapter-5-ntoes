- "In this section, we will evaluate the model's prediction to better understand it..."  You would analyse the models' estimation. Only for one model or for all the ones in the results section? Do not approach the explanation from the "confusion view", instead speak about the robustness and where the cases where the model estimations are not correct (or fails).
- It seems that the followed pararaph also mentios robustness so maybe fuse them and speak about how you plan on analyse the method to find if it is robust or how you did more evaluations to determine if the model is robust -- note that these are two different roads.

- Final informations? ... Final representations? Fully connected what?
- "For example, the following image was generated by plotting the learned features for dierent categories at dierent layers by Lee et al." for which problem? Give context so that the example makes sense.
- Paragraph "So, a correctly trained network should be able to separate those ..." Could you make this example about the traversability problem or related it in a direct way?
- Why is there a section called train set? It does not make sense here or at least it does not is coherent with the past paragraphs, you did not mention that would analyse data from different sets to check the highlevel features (at the last layer) use the previous paragraph to introduce this
- Figure 6.3 add a note about the color opacity, i.e. the more opaque the color the close to the cluster center. 
- The idea of Figure 6.4 is nice, however patches are difficult to recognize, they all look like a gray blob. I do not know how difficult it can be but, you could show (maybe 2 or 3 times their size) some patches from the center of both clusters and from their extreme peripheria aside the plot. Then use these selected patches in your discussion in paragraph "Patches with similar features..."

- "his dataset is harder and present challanging situation for the robot," that are also unseen.
- InterestingLY, but better refer to the figures. "Figure 6.5 shows ...."
