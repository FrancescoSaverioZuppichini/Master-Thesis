\section{Abstract}
With this project, we estimate ground traversability for a legged crocodile-like robot. We generate different synthetic grounds and let the robot walk on them in a simulated environment to collect its interaction with the terrain.  

Then, we train a deep convolutional neural network using the data collected through simulation to predict wether a given ground patch can be traverse or not. Later, we highlight the strength and weakness of our method
by using interpretability techniques to visualise the network's behaviour in interesting scenarios.
