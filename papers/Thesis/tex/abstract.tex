\section{Abstract}
With this project, we estimate ground traversability for a legged crocodile-like robot. We generate different synthetic grounds and let the robot walk on them in a simulated environment to collect its interaction with the terrain.  

Then, we train a deep convolutional neural network using the data collected through simulation to predict wether a given ground patch can be traverse or not. Later, we explain the results by visualising different datasets and custom terrain using different techniques to interpret and highlight strength and weakness of our method.
