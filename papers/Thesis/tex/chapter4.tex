\section{Results}
In the section we show and evaluate the models results. We will start by presenting to the reader the networks score on each metric, then we will use the best models to predict the traversability of real world terrain. Finally, we will use handcrafted patches, for example a wall of a certain height in a specific position, to test the robustness of the network by trying to highlighting its behaviour.
